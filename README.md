Project Goal: Design and analyze a controlled experiment to determine the significance of multiple independent factors (bread, topping, butter) on a continuous performance metric (ant count).



Methodology: Utilized Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to test main effects and applied Multiple Comparison Correction procedures (Holm's Method, Tukey's HSD) to rigorously identify specific factor-level differences while maintaining overall error control.



Outcome: Successfully performed statistical inference using Python/Statsmodels to isolate significant factors impacting the measured output, demonstrating competence in complex controlled test analysis.
